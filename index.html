        <p>Press P to Pause/Resume the Minion and the Hero</p>
        <p>Minion: Press WASD to queue directional movement while paused (*Try to get all the way to the right without touching a line) </p>
        <p>Hero: Same as Minion +  Press 1,2,3,4 to queue places to go to while paused </p>
        <p>Notice how the minion on the bottom still moves even though its paused, its not an RTP Game Object like the others</p>
